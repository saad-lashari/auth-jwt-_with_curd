# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to consider not ignoring
#   `.python-version` so that the desired python version is specified.
#   However, for reasonably modern projects, it is more common to specify the
#   python version in `pyproject.toml`.
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to Peps, Pipfile.lock should be committed to version control.
#   However, certain use cases may require that it be ignored.
#   (e.g. applications that are meant to be widely distributed).
#   See also: https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/#pipfile-lock-discussions
